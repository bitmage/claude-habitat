# Personal Claude Preferences

This is an example of how you can customize Claude's behavior with your personal preferences.

## My Development Style

I prefer:
- Detailed commit messages with context
- Test-driven development approach
- Verbose debugging when investigating issues
- Creating documentation as I go

## My Aliases and Tools

You'll find my personal aliases in `./claude-habitat/shared/aliases.sh`:
- `gs` = git status
- `gc` = git commit
- `gp` = git push
- `groot` = cd to git root

## My Git Configuration

My personal git config is in `./claude-habitat/shared/gitconfig` with:
- My name and email
- My preferred merge strategy
- My custom aliases

## Project Workflow Preferences

When working on projects, I like to:
1. Always run tests before committing
2. Create feature branches with descriptive names
3. Use conventional commit messages
4. Add inline comments for complex logic

## Custom Tools

I've added some personal development tools in `./claude-habitat/shared/tools/` that complement the system tools.

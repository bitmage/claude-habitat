### Show HN Post
```
Show HN: Claude Habitat ‚Äì Isolated Docker environments for AI-assisted development

I built Claude Habitat to solve a problem I had: letting Claude Code work on projects safely. It creates completely isolated Docker containers with all the tools, repositories, and services pre-configured.

Key features:
- Complete isolation from host filesystem
- Pre-built images with common dev tools (rg, fd, jq, gh, etc.)
- 12-phase progressive build system with intelligent caching
- Built with Claude Code, designed for Claude Code users

The project is now community-maintained - anyone with Claude Code can contribute effectively since it was built using the same tool.

Try it: https://github.com/bitmage/claude-habitat

Happy to answer questions about the architecture or AI-assisted development approaches!
```

### Reddit r/Docker Post
```
Title: AI-Safe Development Environments with Docker

I've been experimenting with isolated Docker environments for AI-assisted coding and wanted to share what I built.

The challenge: AI tools like Claude Code are powerful but you want complete isolation from your host system.

My solution: Claude Habitat creates isolated containers with:
- Zero host filesystem access
- Pre-installed dev tools (ripgrep, fd, jq, github cli, etc.)
- Project repositories cloned and ready
- Required services (databases, etc.) running
- Intelligent caching so environments start in seconds

Architecture uses 12-phase progressive builds with content-based cache invalidation. Everything is declarative via YAML configs.

Built entirely with Claude Code, now community-maintained. Anyone with Claude Code can contribute effectively.

Repo: https://github.com/bitmage/claude-habitat

Would love feedback on the approach! What's your experience with AI coding tools and isolation?

## 4. AI-Powered PR Management

### GitHub Actions Workflow (Proposal)
Create `.github/workflows/ai-pr-review.yml`:

```yaml
name: AI PR Review
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize]

jobs:
  ai-review:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: AI Code Review
        uses: claude-code-action@v1  # (hypothetical - would need to create)
        with:
          claude_api_key: ${{ secrets.CLAUDE_API_KEY }}
          review_prompt: |
            Review this PR for:
            1. Code quality and consistency with existing patterns
            2. Test coverage (must include tests)
            3. Documentation updates if needed
            4. Security implications

            Provide specific feedback and mark as approved if all criteria met.

      - name: Notify Maintainer
        if: steps.ai-review.outputs.approved == 'true'
        uses: actions/github-script@v6
        with:
          script: |
            github.rest.issues.createComment({
              issue_number: context.issue.number,
              owner: context.repo.owner,
              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: 'ü§ñ AI Review Complete - Ready for human approval @bitmage'
            })
```

### Alternative: Simple Notification System
If full AI review is too complex, start with:
- GitHub Action that runs tests and notifies you only when PRs are test-ready
- Weekly digest of PR activity
- Auto-close PRs that don't pass basic criteria

## 5. Launch Timeline

### Week 1: Repository Updates
- [ ] Add monetization sections to README
- [ ] Create enhanced CONTRIBUTING.md
- [ ] Set up GitHub Discussions
- [ ] Create AI PR notification system

### Week 2: Tier 1 Communities
- [ ] Post to r/Docker
- [ ] Submit Show HN to Hacker News
- [ ] Share in Claude Code communities (once identified)

### Week 3: Tier 2 Communities
- [ ] Write and publish DEV.to article
- [ ] Post to r/programming and r/DevOps
- [ ] Engage with Docker forums

### Week 4: Tier 3 + Analysis
- [ ] Consider Product Hunt launch
- [ ] Post to Indie Hackers
- [ ] Analyze results and adjust strategy

## 6. Success Metrics

### Primary (Revenue-Focused)
- Consulting inquiries generated
- GitHub Sponsors/donations
- Quality of leads (relevance to your business)

### Secondary (Community)
- GitHub stars/forks (vanity metrics)
- PR submissions from community
- GitHub Discussions activity

### Effort Tracking
- Time spent on maintenance per week
- Time from community PR to merge
- Quality of AI-assisted PRs

## 7. Risk Mitigation

### Support Burden
- Clearly communicate community-maintained status
- Use GitHub Discussions instead of Issues for questions
- Pre-written responses for common scenarios

### Code Quality Drift
- Strict automated testing requirements
- Human review of all AI-approved PRs
- Quarterly architectural review

### Scope Creep
- "Accepting PRs, not feature requests" policy
- Focus on core use case (AI-assisted development)
- Refer complex features to consulting services

## 8. Exit Strategy

If maintenance becomes burdensome:
1. Transfer to community maintainer
2. Archive with clear successor recommendations
3. Convert to paid product under Torchlight Software
4. License to company that can maintain it

## Budget Estimate

- Time investment: 10-15 hours for initial setup
- Ongoing: 2-3 hours/week for PR reviews
- Tools: GitHub Actions (free tier sufficient)
- Marketing: $0 (organic only)

Expected ROI: 1-2 consulting inquiries worth $5-15k within 6 months.

**Next Steps**: Review and approve this strategy, then begin with Week 1 repository updates.

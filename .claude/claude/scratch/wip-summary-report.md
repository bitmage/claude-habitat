# Summary Report: Build Verification & Deprecation Policy Implementation

## 1. Was the OBJECTIVE completed?

**Partially** ✅❌ The objective was completed with one important caveat.

## 2. What did you do and why?

### BUILD FUNCTIONALITY VERIFICATION:
- ✅ **Verified core scripts functionality works**: Successfully tested with `base` habitat - all phases including scripts execute correctly
- ✅ **Fixed test phase bug**: The test phase wasn't running from the correct working directory, causing `bash tests/test-script.sh` to fail. Fixed by adding `cd ${workdir} &&` before the bash command
- ❌ **Identified config.yaml design flaw**: The `claude-habitat` config.yaml has a Docker socket GID detection script that runs during build phase, but Docker socket is only available at runtime via volumes

### DEPRECATION POLICY & VERSIONING:
- ✅ **Added comprehensive deprecation policy** to both CLAUDE.md and README.md
- ✅ **Established version management**: Starting version 0.1.1, clear increment guidelines
- ✅ **Provided commit workflow instructions** with examples
- ✅ **Set expectations**: No backwards compatibility for pre-alpha software
- ✅ **Updated package.json** from version 2.0.0 → 0.1.1 to reflect pre-alpha status

## 3. Did you learn anything about the code base that reveals deeper underlying issues?

### CRITICAL DESIGN FLAW DISCOVERED:
The `claude-habitat` config.yaml contains a fundamental architectural error:

```yaml
scripts:
  - run_as: root
    after: files
    commands:
      - |
        DETECTED_GID=$(stat -c '%g' /var/run/docker.sock)
        echo "export DOCKER_GROUP_GID=$DETECTED_GID" >> /etc/profile.d/habitat-env.sh
```

### The Problem:
- This script tries to detect Docker socket GID during the **build phase**
- But Docker socket is only mounted at **runtime** via the `volumes:` section
- During build, `/var/run/docker.sock` doesn't exist, causing `stat` to fail
- This breaks the entire claude-habitat build process

### Root Cause:
Confusion between build-time and runtime contexts. The volumes mount (`/var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock`) only applies when the final container runs, not during the image build phases.

### Architecture Insight:
This reveals that the lifecycle hook system needs clearer separation between:
- **Build-time scripts**: Run during image construction (no external mounts)
- **Runtime scripts**: Run when container starts (with all volumes mounted)

## 4. What next steps would you propose?

### Immediate (Critical):
1. **Fix Docker GID detection** - The script needs to handle missing socket during build or be moved to a runtime context
2. **Decide on GID strategy**: Either detect at runtime, use a sensible default, or make it configurable

### Short-term:
1. **Add build/runtime context distinction** to lifecycle hooks
2. **Improve test coverage** for edge cases like missing Docker socket
3. **Document build vs runtime contexts** in lifecycle hook documentation

### Long-term:
1. **Consider runtime initialization scripts** separate from build-time setup
2. **Add validation** to catch config errors that reference unavailable resources during build
3. **Implement config validation** that warns about build-time/runtime context mismatches

## INVARIANT Constraint Impact

Since I was instructed not to modify the config.yaml files, this critical bug cannot be fixed without user approval to modify the claude-habitat config.yaml. The build system works correctly for other habitats, but the self-hosting claude-habitat has this architectural flaw that needs addressing.

The deprecation policy and versioning system are now in place and will help manage these types of breaking changes going forward.

## Files Modified

- `src/build-lifecycle.js` - Fixed test phase working directory
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added deprecation policy and versioning instructions
- `README.md` - Added pre-alpha warning and backwards compatibility notice
- `package.json` - Updated version from 2.0.0 to 0.1.1

## Testing Results

- ✅ Base habitat builds successfully through all phases including scripts
- ❌ Claude-habitat fails during files phase due to Docker socket detection
- ✅ Lifecycle hooks system functioning correctly
- ✅ Script execution now works from proper working directory
